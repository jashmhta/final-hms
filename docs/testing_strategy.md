# Zero-Bug Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy to achieve 100% test coverage and eliminate bugs.

## Test Coverage Expansion
- Unit tests for all functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests with Playwright
- Property-based tests with Hypothesis
- Mutation testing with Mutmut

## Test Automation Framework
- Factory Boy for test data
- Pytest-xdist for parallel execution
- Pytest-html for reporting
- Automated CRUD test generation

## Bug Prevention
- Pre-commit hooks: Black, Flake8, Bandit, MyPy, Isort
- CI/CD gates: 100% coverage, no security issues
- Static analysis with zero tolerance

## Quality Assurance
- TDD standards enforced
- Comprehensive documentation
- Regression testing on every PR
- Performance/load testing with Locust

## Zero-Bug Policy
- No commits without tests
- Automated bug detection
- Comprehensive error handling
- Monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
