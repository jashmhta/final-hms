# Architecture Decision Record (ADR): Microservices Decomposition Strategy

**Status**: Approved
**Date**: 2025-09-20
**Authors**: Enterprise Architecture Team
**Tags**: architecture, microservices, decomposition

## Context

The current HMS system is a monolithic Django application with multiple integrated modules (patients, appointments, EHR, billing, etc.). The current architecture presents several challenges:

1. **Scalability**: Limited horizontal scaling capabilities
2. **Maintainability**: Tightly coupled components making changes difficult
3. **Performance**: Shared database and resources causing contention
4. **Deployment**: All-or-nothing deployment approach
5. **Technology**: Single technology stack limitations

## Decision

We will transform the HMS monolith into a microservices architecture using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. The transformation will follow these strategies:

### Service Decomposition Approach

1. **Bounded Context Identification**: Group related functionality by business domains
2. **Database per Service**: Each microservice will own its database
3. **API Gateway**: Centralized entry point with routing and security
4. **Event-Driven Communication**: Asynchronous communication between services
5. **Service Mesh**: Infrastructure for service-to-service communication

### Service Boundaries

Based on DDD analysis, we've identified these bounded contexts:

#### Core Clinical Services
1. **Patient Service**: Patient demographics, demographics, registration
2. **Clinical Service**: EHR, clinical notes, diagnoses, treatment plans
3. **Appointment Service**: Scheduling, calendar management, resource allocation
4. **Pharmacy Service**: Medication management, prescriptions, inventory
5. **Laboratory Service**: Test ordering, results, quality control
6. **Radiology Service**: Imaging, reports, DICOM management

#### Administrative Services
7. **Billing Service**: Charges, claims, payments, revenue cycle
8. **Authentication Service**: User management, OAuth, RBAC
9. **Audit Service**: Compliance logging, audit trails
10. **Facility Service**: Hospital management, departments, rooms

#### Support Services
11. **Notification Service**: Alerts, communications, SMS/email
12. **Analytics Service**: Business intelligence, reporting
13. **Integration Service**: Third-party integrations
14. **File Service**: Document management, attachments
15. **Cache Service**: Distributed caching layer

## Consequences

### Benefits
1. **Scalability**: Independent scaling of each service based on demand
2. **Technology Flexibility**: Different technologies for different services
3. **Resilience**: Isolation of failures prevents system-wide outages
4. **Development Speed**: Parallel development with smaller teams
5. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify individual services

### Challenges
1. **Complexity**: Distributed system complexity increases
2. **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency instead of ACID transactions
3. **Network Latency**: Service-to-service communication overhead
4. **Monitoring**: Need for distributed tracing and observability
5. **Deployment**: Requires DevOps and CI/CD automation

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Service Mesh**: Istio for service communication management
2. **Event Sourcing**: Kafka for reliable event communication
3. **CQRS**: Separate read and write models for performance
4. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
5. **CI/CD**: GitOps workflows with ArgoCD

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Services (Weeks 1-4)
- Extract Patient, Appointment, and Authentication services
- Implement API Gateway and service discovery
- Setup monitoring and observability

### Phase 2: Clinical Services (Weeks 5-8)
- Extract Clinical, Pharmacy, Laboratory, and Radiology services
- Implement event-driven architecture
- Setup service mesh

### Phase 3: Administrative Services (Weeks 9-12)
- Extract Billing, Audit, and Facility services
- Implement advanced security and compliance
- Setup multi-region deployment

### Phase 4: Support Services (Weeks 13-16)
- Extract Notification, Analytics, and Integration services
- Implement advanced analytics and ML capabilities
- Finalize disaster recovery

## Technology Stack

### Backend Services
- **Framework**: FastAPI/Python for performance
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with read replicas
- **Cache**: Redis for distributed caching
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka for events
- **Authentication**: JWT with OAuth 2.0

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker + Kubernetes
- **Service Mesh**: Istio
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana + Jaeger
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + ArgoCD
- **Storage**: S3-compatible object storage

### Security
- **Network**: mTLS for service-to-service communication
- **Authentication**: RBAC with JWT
- **Compliance**: HIPAA/GDPR compliant data handling
- **Audit**: Comprehensive audit logging

## Success Criteria

1. **Performance**: 99.9% uptime, <100ms response time for critical services
2. **Scalability**: Handle 10x current load with linear scaling
3. **Compliance**: Pass all HIPAA/GDPR compliance audits
4. **Developer Experience**: 50% reduction in deployment time
5. **Business Value**: Enable new features and integrations

## Future Considerations

1. **Multi-tenancy**: Support for multiple hospital instances
2. **AI/ML Integration**: Advanced analytics and predictions
3. **Mobile Services**: Dedicated mobile backend services
4. **IoT Integration**: Medical device connectivity
5. **Blockchain**: Secure medical record sharing
